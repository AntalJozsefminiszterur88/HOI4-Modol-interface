# HOI4 Modding Interface

This repository contains a very lightweight structure for building a HOI4 modding interface.

- `frontend` – a React (Vite) based single page application.
- `backend` – a Laravel compatible API using MySQL.

These folders are intentionally minimal so they can be expanded locally by running `npm install` and `composer install` if desired.
